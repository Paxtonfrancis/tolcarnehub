Brief:
The purpose of this project is to create a Lost and Found system that allows hostel students and staff to easily record, view, and manage items that have been lost or found. For this assessment, I am focusing only on building a functional Lost and Found page. This includes the form where users can enter details about an item, the connection to Supabase where the information is stored, and the display of the items as cards on the webpage. The webpage will not run from the code, as it is connected to netifly, to view the website running follow this link
