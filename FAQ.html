<button type="button" class="collapsible"> What to Bring to Tolcarne? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p> Many recommend bringing a stuffed teddy or something special from home. 
    At the start of the year, only a few girls had them, but it quickly became normal—
    so don’t be shy, bring yours from the beginning!Bring snacks! Keeping a stash in your room is always a win.
    And don’t forget to pack heaps of photos—there’s plenty of space on the pinboards to fill with memories.

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> How should I deal with living with so many girls? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Living with alot of girls can be tricky, A tip from an older girl: don’t stress too much about who your friends are at the beginning—it always changes.
     Focus on being kind to everyone (you never know what someone else might be going through) 
     and keep an open mind. If things ever get tricky, try chatting with someone you trust first—like your 
     buddy, before going to the matrons. And if you do need extra support, the matrons are always 
     there and genuinely want to help. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> Is the food good?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The food is pretty good.... but don’t worry, you’re not expected to love every single meal.
     That’s totally normal! But you should definitely try everything!I know my taste buds have changed a lot since starting here.
     But a lot of girls recommend bringing an online card 
     so you can treat yourself to a cheeky Uber Eats on the weekend. 
     Always good to have options (and snacks never hurt either)! </p>
</div>

<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What happens if I stain my clothes or bedding?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Stains are super common at hostel! It’s a great idea to bring your own stain remover 
    (like a spray or stick) at the start of the year.
    If you spill something, try to clean it as soon as you can. 
    Head down to the laundry rinse or scrub the item using your stain remover, 
    then let it dry. Once it’s no longer soaking wet, you can pop it into
     the washing chute and it’ll get picked up with the next laundry round. </p>

<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What are the rules like? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>There are quite a few rules—and it’s definitely worth following them. 
    You really don’t want your phone getting taken off you, 
    especially over something simple like a messy room!
A quick tidy each morning takes five minutes and can save you a lot of hassle. 
Make your bed, clear the floor, and check your shelves—easy stuff that makes a big difference.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">I am scared of the matrons what do I do!?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The matrons can seem scary if you're new, 
    but honestly, they are the most understanding and kind people ever. 
    They will help you with anything you need. Night matorn - always wake them up if you need,
     they are super used to it!
  </p>
</div>

<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible"> What do I need to know about leaving hostel? </button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You have to sign out every time you leave—that’s all for your safety, 
    so they always know where everyone is in case of an emergency.
It’s really important to put your weekend leave in on time, so everything runs smoothly.
    If you’re out on quick leave around town and think you’ll be late, just let the matrons know. 
    They’re super understanding and would much rather you tell them before you get back! </p>

<br>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I get around town?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Make sure you get a bus or taxi card—these are super handy for longer trips around town. 
    Of course, walking is always an option too!
If you need to get to sport, don’t forget to book the van by 6pm Sunday night. 
You can actually book it anytime during the week, but to get the time you want, 
it’s best to do it ASAP. 
Otherwise, you might end up walking or paying a hefty taxi fare to South D. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">How do I deal with homesickness?
</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Girls handle homesickness in different ways. 
    Some find it helpful to call home and catch up—it can make you feel better, 
    though for some it actually makes them miss home more. 
    Another way is to keep busy by signing up for extracurricular activities 
    and staying active. It helps take your mind off things. 
    Here’s a helpful tip from older girls: if you want the weekend to feel longer, 
    try staying at the hostel instead of going home—it really makes the time stretch out. 
    Remember, home is always there and doesn’t change, 
    so don’t ever feel ashamed for missing it. That’s totally normal. </p>
